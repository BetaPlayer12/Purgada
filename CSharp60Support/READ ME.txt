Ok, what should I do?
For C# 6.0

Copy CSharp60Support folder from this repository (or the downloads page) to your Unity project. It should be placed in the project's root, next to the Assets folder.

Import CSharp60Support.unitypackage into your project. It's located inside CSharp60Support folder.

Select Reimport All or just restart the editor, whatever is faster in your case.

[Optional] On Windows, run /CSharp60Support/ngen install.cmd once with administrator privileges. It will precompile csc.exe, pdb2mdb.exe and mcs.exe using Ngen that will make compilation in Unity a bit faster.

For C# 7.0 preview

On MacOS download and install Mono 4.6+. On Windows download and install .Net Framework 4.6.2+.

Copy CSharp70Support folder from this repository (or the downloads page) to your Unity project. It should be placed in the project's root, next to the Assets folder.

Import CSharp70Support.unitypackage into your project. It's located inside CSharp70Support folder.

Select Reimport All or just restart the editor, whatever is faster in your case.

[Optional] On Windows, run /CSharp70Support/ngen install.cmd once with administrator privileges. It will precompile csc.exe, pdb2mdb.exe and mcs.exe using Ngen that will make compilation in Unity a bit faster.

Thus, the project folder is the only folder that changes. All the other projects will work as usual.
